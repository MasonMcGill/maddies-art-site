Born in Sacramento CA in 1986, Madeline Weste is the product of an environmental
chemist and a Mormon religious fanatic turned astrologer. She was raised in a
Waldorf school where she didn't learn to read until she was eight years old. In
Madeline's teens, her mother took over a metaphysical bookstore in town,
exposing the young, impressionable Madeline to psychics, astrologers, energy
healers, tarot readers, palm readers, aura imaging technicians, people who
claimed to make contact with aliens, astrocartographers, and aspiring
breatharians. She also failed briefly as a teen fashion model for an agency in
San Fransisco.

Madeline studied traditional oil painting at the University of Redlands, and in
Cortona, Italy. After graduation, Madeline lived in Seattle, where she taught
art, apprenticed with a master gilder, and illustrated a full color graphic
novel in watercolor called The Adventures of Whaley and Birdface.

Madeline moved to Brooklyn in 2012 without having visited the East Coast, but
figured she was pretty adaptable so why not. She found work as lead artist's
assistant to the sculptor Paul Villinski for nearly four years until she married
a trust funder in 2015, and decided she could get away with just partying and
painting in their baller Clinton Hill loft apartment. Upon discovering her
husband's secret heroin addiction and the decimation of their finances, Madeline
moved out and made a living in antique jewelry for a while, finally moving into
making art full time after being stranded at a tiny California coast surf pad
for the first year of the coronavirus pandemic. She has since moved to Los
Angeles where she paints constantly and is very good at living on next to
nothing.
